    <div><h3>Steps</h3></div>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Beat softened butter, light brown sugar,
            1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon
            vanilla extract together in a large bowl
            until creamy. Add 1 egg; beat until light
            and creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and
            baking soda together in a bowl. Gradually stir
            flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is
            combined. Stir chocolate chips into dough. Spread
            dough into the bottom of the prepared baking dish
            to cover completely.</li>
         <li>Stir 1 cup white sugar, melted butter, and 1
             teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl;
             add 2 eggs and beat well. Mix cocoa powder into
              butter mixture until well-combined. Stir 1/2 cup
             flour, baking powder, and 1/8 teaspoon salt into
              cocoa mixture until batter is combined. Pour
              brownie batter over cookie dough and spread to
              cover completely.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted
            into the center of the brookies comes out clean, 20 
            to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars.</li>

# odin-recipes2
For more practice and replacement for odin-recipe (issue with git committing, detached head)
This is the final product of my recipe project for the Odin Project. In this project, I was able to create a website with an initial page that links to three seperate pages. The idea was to make a homepage allowing the user to click on what recipe they wanted to learn. I included images, headers, descriptions, unordered and ordered lists, and links. I learned the basics on how to create a website in html, and sharpened the skills I previously learned in the Odin Project.
